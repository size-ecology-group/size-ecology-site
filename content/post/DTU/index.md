title: 'A week at the Technical University of Denmark - (almost) all about that size spectrum'
---
It is late at night and rain is storming outside while I stay warm inside a Greek restaurant. There is only one vegetarian option, which still contains calamari for some reasons and it’s with a nice glass of red in one hand that I start to write this small blog post. It’s been a few days that I have been roaming the campus of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), in a small town called Lyngby north of Copenhagen. Unable to use the kitchen in my Airbnb, I have tried all the food places in the area, to finally end up in this nice Greek joint, tired of eating pizzas and wraps. The AirBnB where I’m staying looks like it has been taken straight out of an Asterix comic (see photo in the gallery), with thatch roof and lime wall but it's strangely modern and extremely clean inside. And it will stay this way since I’m not allowed to use the kitchen.

The first time I entered the **[Centre for Ocean life](http://www.oceanlifecentre.dk)**, its modern architecture made me feel like I was inside Relativity from M. C. Escher (see gallery). It took me some time to find Ken H. Andersen’s office, who had invited me to spend some time at the DTU. Within seconds of finding him, however, we were already drawing size spectrums diagrams and talking about model trade-offs, Danish efficiency I assume.


An unfortunate student passing by at that same moment got snatched away and got the mission to show me around the building and meet other scientists I needed to talk to during my stay, him included. I got a desk to be able to leave my stuff in between presentations and coffee-break networking sessions. Coming from a noisy open plan office to a small office with 10 desks so quiet that one would be able to hear a pin drop, I was afraid of even plug in my laptop and disturb everyone.
Nonetheless, my office mates were warm and welcoming. I used my time at the DTU mainly to meet people from Ken’s team, building bridges between the size spectrum community from Tasmania to the one in Denmark. The week went by extremely fast, running between people to meet, presentations to see, presentation to do and even the book launch of **[“Fish Ecology, Evolution and Exploitation - A New Theoretical Synthesis”](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176550/fish-ecology-evolution-and-exploitation)** by Ken. 


With so many people working with size spectrum models there are many aspects and angles of approach to explore with always many ideas going around, a lot of them gravitating around resolving coexistence for multi-species ecosystems. As a matter of fact, I was relieved to see that we have the same kinds of issues and everybody would love to get rid of stock recruitment relationships. Take that, Rmax! 

How nice would it be to have emerging coexistence without having the hard coded restriction of spawn biomass?! A good solution is to make prey less available to be eaten, hiding them from predators, which can be realised in different ways. My preferred approach so far is to use depth as a parameter influencing feeding grounds. Another solution could be a better representation of non-fish species, such as cephalopods, zooplankton and maybe cartilaginous fishes. Would increasing the complexity of the size spectrum increase stability or wreak havoc? Probably a bit of both, I would say. And of course, what are the trade-offs?! In any case, my favourite times were to discuss these topics during the casual breaks with everyone at 3pm next to a machine which had hot chocolate in seemingly infinite supply, tied with getting lost trying to go from an office to another and ending up at a game of table football in one of the building’s secret rooms.

After the size spectrum workshop which was followed by the ICES annual science conference in Sweden, I was happy to find people I had already met. With so many people working on different aspects of the size spectrum, it is as if every time someone else joins the team, a new aspect of the spectrum is discovered which is wonderful! Unfortunately, now it is time to get back to Copenhagen’s train station.

Next stop: Summer in the French countryside. And then it's back to the beautifully cold island of Tasmania and the last chapter of my PhD.
